 SUNRISE 2022 Research Cruise data processing and quality control code

## This directory contains the code required to analysis the data, and the data tree structure

There are two branches to this code, one for the Pelican and the other for the Point Sur. After the cruise, we merge the two branches into a single Shore branch. 

To check out the code for the Pelican branch, please do the following from the command line:

`
git clone git@github.com:mousebrains/SUNRISE2022_code.git code
cd code
git checkout pelican
`

To check out the code for the Point Sur branch, please do the following from the command line:

`
git clone git@github.com:mousebrains/SUNRISE2022_code.git code
cd code
git checkout pointsur
`
